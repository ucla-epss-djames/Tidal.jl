* Description
  This package calculates the tidal response in a planetary structure. Structure
  functions can be pulled from ~Structure.jl~ or the user can design their own
  structures to feed into ~Tidal.jl~.

* Citing
  The method comes from the appendix of the following paper. Further citations
  are provided in the comments of the code.

      abstract = {The internal pattern and overall magnitude of tidal heating for
      spin-synchronous terrestrial exoplanets from 1 to 2.5 RE is investigated
      using a propagator matrix method for a variety of layer structures.
      Particular attention is paid to ice–silicate hybrid super-Earths, where a
      significant ice mantle is modeled to rest atop an iron-silicate core, and may
      or may not contain a liquid water ocean. We find multilayer modeling often
      increases tidal dissipation relative to a homogeneous model, across multiple
      orbital periods, due to the ability to include smaller volume low viscosity
      regions, and the added flexure allowed by liquid layers. Gradations in
      parameters with depth are explored, such as allowed by the Preliminary Earth
      Reference Model. For ice–silicate hybrid worlds, dramatically greater
      dissipation is possible beyond the case of a silicate mantle only, allowing
      non-negligible tidal activity to extend to greater orbital periods than
      previously predicted. Surface patterns of tidal heating are found to
      potentially be useful for distinguishing internal structure. The influence of
      ice mantle depth and water ocean size and position are shown for a range of
      forcing frequencies. Rates of orbital circularization are found to be 10–100
      times faster than standard predictions for Earth-analog planets when interiors
      are moderately warmer than the modern Earth, as well as for a diverse range of
      ice–silicate hybrid super-Earths. Circularization rates are shown to be
      significantly longer for planets with layers equivalent to an ocean-free
      modern Earth, as well as for planets with high fractions of either ice or
      silicate melting.}

* Usage
  The structure data being fed into ~Tidal.jl~ must follow the follow a specific
  format to process correctly. It must be a 2-dim Complex Matrix with such that
  the first row is initial radius and the bottom row is the final radius and
  each column being:
  - radius [m]
  - gravity [m / s^2]
  - shear modulus [Pa]
  - density [kg / m^3]

  The following lines are the simple calls to use ~Tidal.jl~
  #+BEGIN_SRC julia
    using Tidal
    
    # number of layers/rows your structure is
    layers = 100
    
    # creating 4-col matrix
    data = zeros(Complex, layers, 4)
    
    # ... inserting your data structure in matrix
    
    # determines which core matrix to use where
    # ri is the first radial value in structure
    # mu is real shear modulus in that same row
    flag = use_GD_core(ri, mu)
    
    # normalize all values where
    # mass is the total mass of the planet
    # rf is the radius of the planet
    # data is your structure 
    normalize!(mass, rf, data)
    
    # calculating tidal response in planet where
    # l is an integer describing the degree tidal number
    tidal = propagator_method(l, layers, data, flag)
    # tidal will consist of a Complex Matrix with
    # each row corresponding to the row of the structure and
    # each column is [kl, hl, ll] (Tidal Love Numbers)
